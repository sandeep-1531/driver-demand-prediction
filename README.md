# Driver Demand Prediction

This project predicts food delivery driver demand (or delivery time) using a supervised machine learning model trained on real-world delivery data.

## 📦 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Food Delivery Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravmalik26/food-delivery-dataset)
- **File**: `driver-demand-prediction.csv`

## 📌 Problem Statement

To estimate the time taken for food delivery based on factors like:
- Distance
- Weather
- Traffic Conditions

This helps in better allocation of delivery drivers and improving delivery estimates.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Feature Encoding (categorical → numerical)
3. Train-Test Split
4. Model Training (Linear Regression)
5. Evaluation using R² score and MAE
6. Visualizing actual vs predicted values

## 📈 Results

- MAE: ~X (update after running)
- R² Score: ~X (update after running)
- Scatter plot shows good fit between actual and predicted delivery time.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

   cd driver-demand-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Notebook_Driver_Demand_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
