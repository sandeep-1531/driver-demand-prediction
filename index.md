# 🚗 Driver Demand Prediction

This is a machine learning project that predicts food delivery driver demand (or delivery time) based on real-world conditions such as weather, traffic, and distance. It uses Python and scikit-learn for modeling and visualization.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

To estimate the time required for delivery using key features such as:
- Distance to be covered
- Weather conditions
- Traffic density

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Food Delivery Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravmalik26/food-delivery-dataset)
- **File in Repo**: `driver-demand-prediction.csv`

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

---
